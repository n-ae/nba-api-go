## Quality Metrics

### Compilation ‚úÖ
```bash
go build ./pkg/stats/endpoints/...
# Success - all 44 endpoints compile
```

### Demo Programs ‚úÖ
```bash
go build ./examples/tier1_endpoints_demo
go build ./examples/tier2_endpoints_demo
# Both compile and run successfully
```

### Type Safety ‚úÖ
- Proper type inference for all fields
- No `interface{}` in public APIs
- Strongly-typed request/response structures
- Optional parameters via pointers

## What's Next

### To Reach 50% (70 endpoints)
Need 26 more endpoints across:
- Synergy play types
- Additional lineup combinations
- Historical/franchise endpoints
- Playoff-specific advanced stats
- Video/tracking endpoints
- Team comparison endpoints

### Recommended Next Batch (8-10 endpoints)
1. Additional lineup endpoints
2. Synergy play type tracking
3. Historical franchise stats
4. Video tracking endpoints
5. Playoff advanced metrics

**Estimated time:** 2-3 hours  
**Expected coverage:** ~36-38%
