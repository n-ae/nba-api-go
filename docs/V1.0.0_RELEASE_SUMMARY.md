## Deferred Items (Low Priority)

These items remain deferred as they have lower ROI:

### OpenAPI Specification (8-12 hours)
- **Status**: Not needed yet
- **Trigger**: User demand
- **Benefit**: Better API docs, client generation

### Handler Generation (16-24 hours)
- **Status**: No sync issues detected
- **Trigger**: SDK/API duplication becomes problematic
- **Benefit**: Eliminates manual handler writing
