## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `cmd/nba-api-server/handlers.go` (+600 lines)
  - Added 23 new handler functions
  - Added helper functions for pointer conversions
  - Updated switch statement with new routes

- `cmd/nba-api-server/main.go` (updated)
  - Updated health endpoint to show 33 HTTP endpoints
  - Shows both SDK total (139) and HTTP exposed (33)

### Helper Functions Added
```go
func stringPtr(s string) *string
func leagueIDPtr(id parameters.LeagueID) *parameters.LeagueID
func perModePtr(pm parameters.PerMode) *parameters.PerMode
func seasonPtr(s parameters.Season) *parameters.Season
func seasonTypePtr(st parameters.SeasonType) *parameters.SeasonType
```

These helpers handle the pointer conversions needed for optional parameters in the SDK.

### Build Status
✅ **Compiles successfully**

## 📊 Comparison: SDK vs HTTP API

### SDK (Go Package)
- **Endpoints:** 139/139 (100%)
- **Usage:** `import "github.com/.../pkg/stats/endpoints"`
- **Access:** Go applications only
- **Type Safety:** Compile-time checking
- **Performance:** Direct function calls

### HTTP API Server
- **Endpoints:** 33/139 (23.7%)
- **Usage:** REST API calls (curl, fetch, etc.)
- **Access:** Any language/platform
- **Type Safety:** Runtime validation
- **Performance:** HTTP overhead

---

## 🎯 Strategic Coverage

The 33 exposed endpoints were chosen to cover:

**1. Player Analysis (30%)**
- Career stats and profiles
- Game logs and performance
- Dashboard analytics
- Head-to-head matchups

**2. Team Analytics (27%)**
- Game logs and schedules
- Roster information
- Dashboard metrics
- Lineup analysis

**3. Game Data (18%)**
- Box scores (all types)
- Play-by-play
- Shot charts
- Rotations

**4. League-Wide Stats (15%)**
- Game logs
- Standings/Playoffs
- League dashboards
- Lineup analytics

**5. Real-time Data (10%)**
- Scoreboards
- Current standings
- League leaders

## 💡 Usage Patterns

### Direct SDK Usage (Go Apps)
```go
import "github.com/.../pkg/stats/endpoints"

resp, err := endpoints.GetPlayerProfileV2(ctx, client, req)
```

### HTTP API Usage (Any Language)
```bash
# Python
response = requests.get('http://localhost:8080/api/v1/stats/playerprofilev2?PlayerID=2544')

# JavaScript
fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/v1/stats/playerprofilev2?PlayerID=2544')

# curl
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/stats/playerprofilev2?PlayerID=2544'
```

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Would reach:** ~50 endpoints (36% coverage)

### Medium-term (Strategic)
- Add all player tracking endpoints (~15)
- Add all team tracking endpoints (~10)
- Complete league analytics (~10 more)

**Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours  
**Would reach:** ~75 endpoints (54% coverage)

### Long-term (Comprehensive)
- Expose all 139 SDK endpoints
- Add batch/bulk operations
- Add filtering and pagination

**Estimated effort:** 15-20 hours  
**Would reach:** 139 endpoints (100% coverage)
