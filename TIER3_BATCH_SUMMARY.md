## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Synergy Play Types

```go
// Analyze isolation scoring
req := endpoints.SynergyPlayTypesRequest{
    Season:       ptr(parameters.NewSeason(2023)),
    SeasonType:   ptr(parameters.SeasonTypeRegular),
    PlayerOrTeam: ptr("P"),
    PlayType:     ptr("Isolation"),
}

resp, err := endpoints.GetSynergyPlayTypes(ctx, client, req)

// Find elite isolation scorers
for _, player := range resp.Data.SynergyPlayType {
    if player.PERCENTILE >= 90 && player.POSS >= 50 {
        fmt.Printf("%s: %.3f PPP, %.1f%% FG, %d poss\n",
            player.PLAYER_NAME, player.PPP, player.FG_PCT*100, player.POSS)
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Franchise History

```go
resp, err := endpoints.GetFranchiseHistory(ctx, client,
    endpoints.FranchiseHistoryRequest{})

// Find most successful franchises
for _, franchise := range resp.Data.FranchiseHistory {
    if franchise.LEAGUE_TITLES > 5 {
        fmt.Printf("%s %s: %d titles (%.3f win%%)\n",
            franchise.TEAM_CITY, franchise.TEAM_NAME,
            franchise.LEAGUE_TITLES, franchise.WIN_PCT)
    }
}
```

### Example 3: Player Comparison

```go
// Compare LeBron vs Jordan career stats
req := endpoints.PlayerCompareRequest{
    PlayerIDList: "2544,893", // LeBron, Jordan
    PerMode:      ptr(parameters.PerModePerGame),
}

resp, err := endpoints.GetPlayerCompare(ctx, client, req)

// Side-by-side comparison
for _, player := range resp.Data.OverallCompare {
    fmt.Printf("%s: %.1f PPG, %.1f RPG, %.1f APG\n",
        player.PLAYER_NAME, player.PTS, player.REB, player.AST)
}
```

### Example 4: All-Time Leaders

```go
req := endpoints.AllTimeLeadersGridsRequest{
    PerMode:    ptr(parameters.PerModeTotals),
    SeasonType: ptr(parameters.SeasonTypeRegular),
    TopX:       ptr("50"), // Top 50
}

resp, err := endpoints.GetAllTimeLeadersGrids(ctx, client, req)

// All-time scoring leaders
fmt.Println("Top 10 All-Time Scorers:")
for i, player := range resp.Data.AllTimeLeadersPTS[:10] {
    fmt.Printf("%2d. %s - %d points\n",
        i+1, player.PLAYER_NAME, player.PTS)
}
```
