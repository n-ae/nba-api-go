## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Shot Tracking

```go
req := endpoints.PlayerDashPtShotsRequest{
    PlayerID:   "201939", // Curry
    Season:     ptr(parameters.NewSeason(2023)),
    SeasonType: ptr(parameters.SeasonTypeRegular),
}

resp, err := endpoints.GetPlayerDashPtShots(ctx, client, req)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Access different shot types
fmt.Printf("Overall: %d shots\n", len(resp.Data.OverallShooting))
fmt.Printf("By dribbles: %d categories\n", len(resp.Data.DribbleShooting))
fmt.Printf("By defender distance: %d ranges\n", len(resp.Data.ClosestDefenderShooting))
```

### Example 2: Defensive Tracking

```go
req := endpoints.LeagueDashPtDefendRequest{
    Season:          ptr(parameters.NewSeason(2023)),
    DefenseCategory: ptr("Overall"),
}

resp, err := endpoints.GetLeagueDashPtDefend(ctx, client, req)
// Analyze opponent FG% vs normal FG%
for _, def := range resp.Data.LeagueDashPtDefend {
    diff := def.D_FG_PCT - def.NORMAL_FG_PCT
    fmt.Printf("%s: %.1f%% better/worse than avg\n", def.PLAYER_NAME, diff*100)
}
```

### Example 3: Hustle Stats

```go
req := endpoints.LeagueHustleStatsPlayerRequest{
    Season:     ptr(parameters.NewSeason(2023)),
    PerMode:    ptr(parameters.PerModePerGame),
}

resp, err := endpoints.GetLeagueHustleStatsPlayer(ctx, client, req)
// Find hustle leaders
for _, player := range resp.Data.HustleStatsPlayer {
    fmt.Printf("%s: %d deflections, %d charges, %d loose balls\n",
        player.PLAYER_NAME,
        player.DEFLECTIONS,
        player.CHARGES_DRAWN,
        player.LOOSE_BALLS_RECOVERED)
}
```

### Example 4: Clutch Performance

```go
req := endpoints.LeagueDashPlayerClutchRequest{
    Season:      ptr(parameters.NewSeason(2023)),
    ClutchTime:  ptr("Last 5 Minutes"),
    PointDiff:   ptr(5),
}

resp, err := endpoints.GetLeagueDashPlayerClutch(ctx, client, req)
// Analyze clutch performers
for _, player := range resp.Data.LeagueDashPlayerClutch {
    if player.FG_PCT > 0.5 && player.GP > 20 {
        fmt.Printf("Clutch shooter: %s - %.1f%% FG in clutch time\n",
            player.PLAYER_NAME, player.FG_PCT*100)
    }
}
```
